## FAQ

#### Why Create this?

Sometimes I want to create low poly models for my websites and using dat.gui, while extremely accessible and fun, is hard to set up for more than one shape.

My editor is fast to set up. It exports directly to human-readable code (as well as other formats) that you can copy-paste on your own projects and have them working perfectly.

Also, it was an enjoyable challenge, and I wanted to understand more of Threejs's secrets

#### What is it?

Well, it's like an open-source 3D modeling software but for threejs's pre-built shapes. It applies every known material and geometry transformation on the shapes and separates them so that you can work on each one independently, or more than one at a time !!!

-   It's built for scalability, so I'm always adding more.
-   It's easy to use
-   Is best for Low Poly Models though it has features for glass, metal, plastic, and light reflections...
-   almost no memory limitations (fps drops after 281 shapes)

#### What isn't it?

-   It's not a perfect replacement for threejs's editor
-   it's not set up for mobile devices.
-   no dev tools, no sfx editor, no animations editor.
-   minimal prior knowledge in threejs is needed to operate it

#### Can I Contribute?

Everyone's really welcome to take a look at my code and add pull request for any changes they deem fit for the site.

#### Where's the Documentation?

As of now, I'm working on fixing the bugs of the released alpha version but after I'm finished with that. I'll post a developer friendly guide to adding content.
The code is still a mess. I need to seperate lots of code, and pick whether I want to go the functional programming route or the OOP one.
The code is not that hard to understand as it's written specifically for future me to easily get in and change stuff.
There are comments everywhere + I have a txt file full of informations that i'm not putting on github until I'm done with the alpha and release the beta.

#### Can I submit an issue?

YES! Please do. I'd love any kind of feedback so I can turn this into an actual working thing that I'm very much proud of.
