## Lessons Learned

**Programming: **

- Object Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming
- Python (bulk-renaming)
- **Optimizations**
- ThreeJS hidden Constants
- Limitations of Local Storage
- Project Management (deadlines)

- That I should read more on software development

## FAQ

#### Why Create this?

Sometimes I want to create low poly models for my websites and using dat.gui, while extremely accessible and fun, is hard to set up for more than one shape.

My editor is fast to set up. It exports directly to human-readable code (as well as other formats) that you can copy-paste on your own projects and have them working perfectly.

Also, it was an enjoyable challenge, and I wanted to understand more of Threejs's secrets 

#### What is it?

Well, it's like an open-source 3D modeling  software but for threejs's pre-built shapes. It applies every known material and geometry transformation on the shapes and separates them so that you can work on each one independently, or more than one at a time !!!

- It's built for scalability, so I'm always adding more.
- It's easy to use 
- Is best for Low Poly Models though it has features for glass, metal, plastic, and light reflections...
- almost no memory limitations (fps drops after 281 shapes) 

#### What isn't it?

- It's not a perfect replacement for threejs's editor
- it's not set up for mobile devices.
- no dev tools, no sfx editor, no animations editor.
- minimal prior knowledge in threejs is needed to operate it
